3. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles in that direction.
4. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with double the value.
5. Keep combining tiles until you reach the 2048 tile or the board is completely filled with tiles.
6. If you reach the 2048 tile, congratulations! If not, you can try again.
